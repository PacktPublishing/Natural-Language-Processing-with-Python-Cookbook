wrong-o . i've never played the game aside from a 30-minute tour , and now i wish i hadn't seen the movie , either . come now , you say , it can't be that bad ! wasn't wing commander a highly-lauded , critically-acclaimed video game ? maybe the star wars of the pc ? sure . but when you rid yourself of everything but the title and the setting ( redux : humans at war with kilrathi , an evil alien race that look like walking walnuts with beards ) , you'll find you're high and dry . how bad is wing commander ? bad . * really * bad . throughout most of the film , my advance-screening theater was filled with the merry sounds of laughter . alas , there are no ( intentional ) jokes on film . ( disclaimer : said laughter does not count those who had fallen asleep . ) not only does the plot stink , but wing commander has some of the worst dialogue this side of showgirls . the marketing ploy behind wing commander is obvious , and i'll outline the sad history for you so you can get a sense for it . . . . 20th century fox nabs rights to successful video game for crossover hit ( mortal kombat , the movie , was hugely successful ) -maybe even a franchise ! but isn't mark hamill getting old ? replace him with some young , unknown studs and draw the teen crowd ! it'll be cheap ! uh-oh . . . movie's done and it * is * cheap . . . in every way imaginable . shelve the movie . fast-forward a few years . . . uh-oh again ! - prinze and lillard are , surprise , big stars ! release movie with big ad campaign , touting the newly idolized heroes . teens go nuts ! score !
