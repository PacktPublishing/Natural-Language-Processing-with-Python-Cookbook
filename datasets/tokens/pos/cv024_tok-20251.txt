prompted by the recent runaway bride , ( a diaster all it's own ) i decided to rent pretty woman to see what got this tepid film made . it all flashed before my eyes , it was the world's first glimpse into the world of cutesy julia movies . a fun , inventive romantic comedy that starts and ends just like it should . edward lewis ( gere ) buys companies , takes them apart , and sells them bit by bit . he meets vivian ( roberts ) on hollywood way when he asks her for directions to beverly hills . asking her what her name is , she says " what do you want it to be ? " needing to take a load off , he hires her for the night . taking a liking to her , he then hires her for a whole week . but he needs to clean vivian up . buying her dresses and having her learn table manners to attend various dinners so she can appear as his date soon becomes his prime concern . he begins to fall in love with her , but it takes awhile for her to return his affections . vivian also helps him see through buying another family owned company by bringing out the more emotional side of him . pretty woman is extremely cute . cute is the only world for it . i also liked the fact that prostitutes are portrayed as people that need help ( much in the same way that african-american gangsters were showcased in slam . ) the film turns in fine performances by it's two leads , but also from hector elizondo as the hotel manager , and laura san giacomo as julia's prostituting pal . despite minor cliches and problems , the fun romantic comedy pretty woman still gets * * * stars . the young-uns : the title character is a prostitute and there is some sexual discussion as well as bad attitudes towards her . there is also some mild language . good age : 12 & up a review by frankie paiva the 12 year-old movie reviewer e-mail me at swpstke@aol . com visit my website at : http : //expage . com/page/teenagemoviecritic
