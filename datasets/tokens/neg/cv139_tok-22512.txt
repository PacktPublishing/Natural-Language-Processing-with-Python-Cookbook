ever wished longingly for the glory days when you could watch " late night with david letterman " and catch a little bit of that wacky super dave osborne , the stuntman who just can't get things right ? well now you can relive those happy moments at your leisure , by taking super dave home in his theatrical -- er , straight-to-video -- debut : the extreme adventures of super dave ! what , you aren't frantically dialing your phone to reserve your copy at the video store yet ? take off your shoes and put down the car keys . if this video has proven anything , it's that what can be funny for 1/2 a minute probably usually won't make it for 91 . oh , how super dave proves it . in the film , bob einstein , aka super dave osborne , finds himself a washed-up stuntman . his manager has run off with his fortunes , his fun park is failing , and he finds himself in the charge of a sick little boy . dave retires to train up-and-coming stunt stars , and soon an heir apparent arises , even dubbing himself super dave jr . but jr . turns out to be a traitor in the employ of dan hedaya's evil promoter . a grudge match is announced , and super dave must jump half a mile of cars in order to win the prize and save the kid . that smell is not your garbage can , it's this movie , which has all the plot of a box of cheerios . perhaps less , if you include the maze on the back . most of the nutty stunts are repeats from " letterman " 's of old , and while a few earn a chuckle or two , you aren't likely to break much of a smile during the running time of this dog . the production might as well have been made with a handicam , and the shot sequence of dave - car falling - dummy gets crushed by car gets very old , very fast . but wait ! don't give up yet ! filmcritic . com's exclusive inside news says that next we can expect a feature-length " top ten " list ! you gotta dream .
