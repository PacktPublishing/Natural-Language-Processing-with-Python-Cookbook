these are words that could be used to describe the emotions of john sayles' characters in his latest , limbo . but no , i use them to describe myself after sitting through his latest little exercise in indie egomania . i can forgive many things . but using some hackneyed , whacked-out , screwed-up * non * -ending on a movie is unforgivable . i walked a half-mile in the rain and sat through two hours of typical , plodding sayles melodrama to get cheated by a complete and total copout finale . does sayles think he's roger corman ?
