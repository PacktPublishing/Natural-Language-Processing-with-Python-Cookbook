one of the most entertaining james bond films from the roger moore era , the spy who loved me is probably the biggest budget bond movie , with huge sets and props as well as some blockbuster action scenes . and how can you not like a movie that co- stars ringo's wife , barbara bach , and features a non-stop disco version of the traditional series score ? it's a globe-trotting action movie that has bond and mrs . starr , a beautiful russian spy , teaming up to end spectre's latest threat . this time , it's a madman who kidnaps two nuclear submarines , one russian and one american . his plan is to destroy the civilized world as we know it and begin an underwater society . this is somebody who went a little too far after seeing the little mermaid . i know the shell bra is a real turn-on , but give me a break . the bond formula works especially well here . even though the omnipresent disco score becomes annoying and the ski slope chase scene at the beginning is blue screen technology at its worst , there are still more than enough gadgets , explosions , chases , etc . to make up . and as usual , bond's three-woman quota is reached with a little help from mrs . starr , who also makes the movie a standout in the series . most of the beautiful women from the 70's were hidden behind the ugly bell-bottoms and poofy hair , which makes bach's straight-haired , smartly-dressed agent xxx a welcome exception . i'd have to say ringo starr is the luckiest bastard on earth . first his talentless self got to be in the greatest rock and roll band ever , then he married one of the hottest ladies of the 70's , now he gets to eat his pizza _crust first_ ! we should all be so fortunate . visit the movie critic at large website at http : //www . missouri . edu/~c667778/movies . html
