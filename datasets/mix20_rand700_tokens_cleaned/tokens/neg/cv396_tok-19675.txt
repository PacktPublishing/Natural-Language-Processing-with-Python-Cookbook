i still know what you did last summer ( r )  starring jennifer love hewitt , brandy norwood directed by danny cannon a review by frankie paiva obviously , the hook-handed ben willis is at it again , this time it's on an island in the bahamas where the lush surroundings are just bound to turn deadly . in the middle of summertime , julie james ( hewitt ) and her friend karla ( norwood ) are called up by the local radio station . they have to guess the capital of brazil to go on their dream vacation , scrambling around the kitchen , they find a bag of coffee that says it was produced in rio . they guess that , and their vacation begins . karla brings along tyrell ( mekhi phifer ) and reluctant julie is forced into bringing will ( matthew settle ) because her old boyfriend ray ( freddie prinze jr . ) has to work . apparently julie still can't get over the fact that they cut off ben willis's hand and threw him into the water to drown in the last movie but , " they never found the body ! " oh my ! what shocking horror ! the capital of brazil isn't rio , it's brazilia , ben has set them up . he's once again on a vengance gig , back for more action this time killing everyone in sight . i mean , come on , does the housekeeper or the bartender have any idea what julie did last summer ? and what happened to all the people that were on the island ? this film is greatly lacking kevin williamson , who brought spark and witty dialouge to the original . sarah michelle gellar is also not here , couldn't she have been resurrected from the dead in a demonic ritual or something ? this film is so predictable , and it even surpasses the number of cliches that scream mentions and features . i don't care how little hewitt has on for most of the film , so i give it * 1/2 stars .
