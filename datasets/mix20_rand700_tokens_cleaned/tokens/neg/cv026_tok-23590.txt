and here i was , expecting a movie about bullfighting . this cryptic little indie starts out with the story of a frenchman ( olivier martinez ) in mexico , fascinated with bullfighting , indeed . when his cute little girlfriend unleashes a bull on him for some unknown reason , she ends up getting gored . that's bad enough , but her dad turns out to be a major crime boss , and he proceeds to go on a rampage against our poor frenchman . hooking up with mary ( star trek : tng's michelle forbes ) , the duo begin a " fantasy adventure " that transcends any sense of reality , culminating in the birth of a new messiah who is dubbed " pumpkin . " bullfighter is ultimately a blatant ripoff of robert rodriguez's el mariachi , made for obviously no money by indie vet l . m . kit carson and his crew . strangely enough , rodriguez actually has a cameo in this movie , which says to me he's paying off carson for all his support of indie filmmaking . and while el mariachi is a truly great film , bullfighter is anything but . the story is supposed to be farcical ( i think ) , but it just comes off as stupid and tiresome . the camerawork is bad , the editing is atrocious ( each scene transition uses a grating jump-back-and-forth-five-times method which makes you want to kill yourself after 10 minutes of it ) . the special effects typically involve a strobe light . this is not a good thing . what is mildly good is forbes ( the only real actor in the picture ) , and martinez makes for a curiously understated action hero . if only he didn't mutter all his lines beneath his breath , thus rendering the picture even less comprehensible .
