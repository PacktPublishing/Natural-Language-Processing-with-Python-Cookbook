in one of the most hyped films of the past decade , armageddon is a mega-bust . a disaster flick that is a disaster on every level . not even bruce willis can save this expensive , incoherent , derivative mess . following in the superior deep impact's heels , armageddon tells the mudding tale of an asteroid the size of texas on a collision course with earth . the film fails to mention how this particular hunk of space rock was detected by nasa , or even the inept script-hole that shows a u . s . spacecraft being obliterated in orbit by a comet shower , followed by the destruction of manhattan . oops . nasa couldn't see that ? i guess when you are billy bob thornton ( playing a nasa official ) , you kinda wonder how such a wonderful actor as yourself is reduced to rubish like armageddon . willis plays harry stamper , " the world's best oil driller , " who is called into action ( just like it die hard , mercury rising , die hard 2 ! ) . i have no idea why harry , and his retarted group of drillers , are called for a job that if failed , would mean the end of life as we know it . i guess it would seem cooler to have a bunch of dudes rescuing us from complete death and destruction than some smart , well-mannered scientist-cume-amercian hero . the dvd of the movie is okay . it contains a trailer , i believe a commentary ( i was so looking forward to taking this disc out of my machine , i didn't notice ) , and some other mumbo jumbo . the soundtrack is wide and good , but , like the cast , this disc is just worthless .
