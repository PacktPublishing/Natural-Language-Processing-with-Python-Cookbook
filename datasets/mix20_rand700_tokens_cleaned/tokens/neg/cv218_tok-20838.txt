the word `unfilmable' is often bandied about over cult classic books . that never stops people from filming them . witness the english patient , which turned out to be filmable after all . and then there was fear and loathing in las vegas , which wasn't . but maybe unfilmable is the wrong word . breakfast of champions might have proved filmable , but it sure isn't watchable . this , of course , saddens me greatly . kurt vonnegut is my favorite author ever , and breakfast of champions was his first book that i read . it made enough of an impression for me to track down his entire oeuvre , which i have devoured . this film just shouldn't have been made , sadly . take cat's cradle ( his second-best work ) next time – that ought to make a great film . why is this breakfast so bad ? because the book is about craziness . dwayne hoover ( willis ) is a crazy auto salesman , married to a crazy wife ( hershey ) , and he becomes obsessed with a crazy sci-fi writer named kilgore trout ( finney ) . trout's sales manager ( nolte ) is also a crazy guy that likes to dress in women's lingerie , and his secretary ( headley ) isn't all together . oh , and trout's son ( haas ) wants to be a lounge singer named bunny . what made the book so good is that you can go inside these characters , heads , plus vonnegut's writing style is so nutty that it all actually works . director rudolph tries to do this , too , with wacky camera angles , digital effects , and other tricks , but none of this works . in fact , it's just annoying and is barely entertaining for even a minute . a couple of wisecracks aside , this breakfast is unedible .
