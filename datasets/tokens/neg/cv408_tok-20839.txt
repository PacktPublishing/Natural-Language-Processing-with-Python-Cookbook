it is rare that a great actress ( garofalo ) will make two * really * bad movies , back to back . it is even rarer that those two movies will premiere on the same day . and what are the odds that those two films will star brothers ( eg . luke wilson in this movie and owen wilson in the minus man ) ? according to my astrologer/numerologist , it's an 18 billion to one shot . and yet it happened here , when two of the worst films to grace the silver screen have been star-crossed in this conflagration of irony . there's very little worth writing about in dog park . ex-kid in the hall bruce mcculloch wrote , directed , and starred in this paean to canines , where a bunch of singles in what looks like boston meet around the local dog park and embark on a romantic affair here and there . central to this epic saga are lorna ( henstridge , looking really bizarre with a short hairdo ) and andy ( wilson , playing dumb , as he did in home fries ) . garofalo and mcculloch make another couple , and various other people intersect the four romantically , all with very little in the way of a point or anything funny -- and with * zero * chemistry in the entire lot . as a fan of `kids in the hall , ' this is quite a disappointment . of course , brain candy , mcculloch's other writing credit , wasn't a whole lot better . and watch for superstar , mcculloch's * next * directorial outing , next week . a couple of one-liners here and there , and a notable supporting role by mckinney as a dog trainer/psychologist earn dog park its half a star , but believe me , these 93 minutes feel like an eternity with nary a laugh to be heard . not convinced yet ? here's the teaser copy from dog park's web site : `i think andy starts to fall in love with lorna when she pukes on him .
