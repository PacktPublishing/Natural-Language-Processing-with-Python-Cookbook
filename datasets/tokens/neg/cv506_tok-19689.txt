" we've got a pretty thin slate this year until the next bond film comes out . what can we do to beef it up a little ? " " sequels and remakes always do reasonable business . " " yes , but we've already done the mod squad , and we've still got the remake of the thomas crown affair on the way . " " why not do another , but let's call it a sequel , just to be different . " " i know the perfect film , too ! remember that fantastic horror film from 1976 . that one about the tormented adolescent with telekinetic powers who destroyed her school on prom night . that one that made the reputations of both brian de palma and stephen king ? what was it called . . . carrie ? it's old enough now that most of today's audiences probably won't have seen it , or won't remember it .
