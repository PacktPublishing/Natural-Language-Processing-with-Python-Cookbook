okay , let's get thing straight , right up front . if you have been led to believe from the trailers that the story of us is a romantic comedy , you are in for a huge shock . this is a mean , bad , melodramatic horror story about two bickering people . there is little comedy to be had in the entire thing . which is a surprise . this is the man who brought us the masterful comedy when harry met sally . and here we are , with people on couches , talking to the camera about their relationship . same premise , right ? ohhhhhhh noooooo . the story of us can be summed up quite simply : bruce willis and michelle pfeiffer * hate * each other . they spend two hours yelling , cursing , crying , and pouting . then maybe they get back together . the end . great film ? uh , no . proof that people like rob reiner have too much power . when you find yourself spending the whole film trying to read the wine labels in the scenes , you know you're watching something that's going to be remembered as one of the worst films of the year . even the music is annoying – the same acoustic guitar-based eric clapton song is played at least six times .
