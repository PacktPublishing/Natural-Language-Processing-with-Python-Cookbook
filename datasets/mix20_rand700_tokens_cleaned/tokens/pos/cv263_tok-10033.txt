 in a world where children are genetically screened and filtered before birth , vincent is born with no artificial genetic help from his parents . which is too bad for him because he is born into a society where a job interview consists solely of evaluating your dna . vincent's parents decide to have another child - a boy , for vincent . this time they get the help of a geneticist . so vincent grows up weaker , shorter and less graceful than his younger brother anton . if that weren't enough , mom and dad treat the boys differently , as if vincent might break from the same fall that anton brushes off . understandably , vincent grows up wanting to get as far away from home - and from people - as possible , all the way to the moons of jupiter .
