literally blink , and you'll miss _soldier_'s lone flash of wit : a fleeting glimpse of a computer screen listing futuristic supersoldier todd's ( kurt russell ) numerous war commendations , among them the " plissken patch " --referring , of course , to russell's character in john carpenter's _escape_from . . . _ movies . the rest of this sci-fi actioner is brainless junk though writer david webb peoples and director paul anderson serve up an interesting basic premise . in the future , a select few males are chosen at birth to be trained their whole life as soldiers , nothing more ; veteran soldier todd is among the best , if not _the_ best . but when a new genetically engineered brand of soldier is developed , todd and his ilk are rendered obsolete . from here , the story takes a most uninspired turn . presumed dead , todd is dumped onto a trash dump planet , where he meets up with a peaceful community of people who look and act like extras from _the_postman_ . for reasons that are never clear , the new soldiers attack this trash planet , and the film becomes an outer space _rambo_ , boldly declaring , " i'm gonna kill 'em all , sir ! " thus ensues much machine gun action and laughable " emotional " content where todd finds the humanity within his tough exterior . it plays even worse than it sounds .
