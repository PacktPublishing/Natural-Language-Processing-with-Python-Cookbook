a young couple have split and are fighting over custody of their dog , mowgli . another , seemingly perfect , couple have two dogs . a lonely woman who hosts a children's tv show has a dog called peanut . they all take their pets to the dog park . they all take them to the same obedience instructor . and pretty soon they have all met . this is a film about relationships and how they do and don't work . andy misses mowgli . and his exgirlfriend cheryl gives up custody whent their pet's therapist says mowgli's sudden unhappiness is due to witnessing cheryl and her boyfriend have boisterous sex . since andy isn't having any sex , his house is a better home . but andy meets lorna ( peanuts owner ) . they meet in a bar where she picks him up and they go to his place where she promptly throws up . despite this less than best first date , andy likes her and sends her flowers - against the advice of his friend jeri ( the female half of the perfect couple ) . but lorna throws out the flowers and vows never to see him again . jeri then convinces andy to participate in a bachelor auction for charity . he's purchased , for $100 , by a vegan physical therapist who starts causing real problems for mowgli when she and andy start having some very energetic sex . but andy doesn't really love her , he's just terrified of not being in a relationship . something shared by almost everyone in the film . the dogs may be in obedience school ( and some of the comedic highlights come from their instructor who firmly believes dogs are better than children ) but it's the owners who need training . they lack any self control and are driven by their passions and fears . of course , we all know how a romantic comedy like this ends , but it is fun getting there . the dogs are cute , the relationships close to real , and the dialogue reasonable . if you liked movies like ed's next move , you'll love this .
