some movies , while not totally bad , just piss me off . roger kumble's lame excuse for a drama cruel intentions fits perfectly into this category . loosely based on the famous novel " les liaisons dangereuses " , " intentions " tells the story of sebastian and kathryn valmont , two wealthy new york step-siblings who are the cause of lots of damage . sebastian ( ryan phillippe ) has a reputation of promising women the world to get them in bed , and then dumping them . kathryn ( sarah michelle gellar ) , equally evil but more inconspicuous , is also manipulative , in the way that she helps out with sebastian's games . in the first of many plot contrivations , kathryn bets her brother that he cannot devirginize annette ( reese witherspoon , phillippe's real-life girlfriend ) , daughter of their new school headmaster and self-proclaimed virgin till marriage . if kathryn wins , then she gets sebastian's car , and if sebastian wins , he gets to bed kathryn , the one woman whom he supposedly can't have . well , anyway , although sebastian is cruel to the fullest sense of the word , annette can't help but fall for him . i mean , damn , this guy is manipulative ! from that point the film just spins way out of control , juggling a subplot featuring a teenager ( selma blair ) also getting involved in their schemes . the movie then goes for cheap melodrama and any cliche it can think of . none of the film's characters are at all real , and none of them make any decisions that a normal human would make . although many sexual cliches are added in just so that teens will have a little fun , this film is another case where the trailer is more fun than the movie . i mean , with a cast like this , the producers did not need to make a good film in order to ensure that every teenager in the world will see it . but i wish they at least tried .
