clerks is raunchy , obscene , cheap and very funny throughout . made for just 27 , 000 , and set mostly in a convenience store , this represents a vry good film made for very little money . often films get special treatment and consideration if they cost less , and this is unfair because it can be done . clerks cronicles the day of a quick stop convience store clerk dante and his buddy randal next door who runs a bad video store . randal shows up and starts utterly pointless yet often hilarious results . did independent contractors get killed in the later of the star wars tilogy , it was still being built when it was blown up ? kevin smith , the films writer and director , said that randal represented who he wants to be and dante is who he is closest to . you can tell by the dialogue provided for his characters . dante is a loser , he pins for two women and doesn't understand when one of them gets upset , he also complains about his job constantly . randal doesn't care about anything , he sits around , bs's with dante and somethimes the costumers ( when he's not assaulting them ) , he is also provided with a great deal of the funny dialogue . jeff anderson , who plays russel , hasn't acted since his turn in clerks . this is very unfortunate , anderson provides perfectly cynical spins on every line of dialogue , making even the dialogue that doesn't quite work seem funny . smith is moving towards bigger movies with bigger stars and i wish we would get another look at anderson and brian o'halloran in more films . in clerks they have a perfectly funny chemistry , and deliver this movie home . people have criticized the acting in this film , calling it a true sign of the films budget . i think the acting is perfect for this films feel , and i want to see more of them .
