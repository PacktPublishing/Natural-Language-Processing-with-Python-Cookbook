i challenge any film reviewer to find an animated film that is more sickeningly bad , predictable , and stupidly sappy than this one . the winner ( if one finds a film worse than this ) will receive the chance to remove this movie from all video shelves across america . kayley ( jessalyn gilsig ) has always dreamed of becoming a knight of the round table just like her father sir lionel ( gabriel bryne ) so when the evil ruber ( gary oldman , who's character is scarier than he is ) has his griffin steal excalibur , he plans to rule all , but the griffin drops it in the " forbidden forest . " kayley runs away from her mother ( jane seymour ) to find the famed sword where she meets up with a blind man ( elwes ) who has magically lived his entire life in the forest alone with a falcon that helps him see . throw in a two-headed wisecracking dragon and you've got probably one of the worst family films ever made . never mind that the animation is pretty , and kayley always remains pretty and clean throughout the entire movie , this is just plain bad material ( that doesn't deserve this long of a review ) and for that i give it a paltry  stars .
