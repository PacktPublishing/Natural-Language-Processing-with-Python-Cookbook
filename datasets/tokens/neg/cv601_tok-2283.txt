" expectations " may be an obsession of mine , but i'll say it : * if you can park virtually every expectation at the door * , this will be a flick that can become addictive . it will hit you on more levels than most three other movies . it's a romp--the sort of thing lots of us wanted to do as kids--screw everything , grab a car , and beat it for the border . it's an adventure--where the stakes are high , and the hero must play everything right or face disaster . it's a comedy--where adults are somewhat silly , and two kids create their own universe . it's sort of like a horror story , but without magic or the supernatural--where the demons are utterly ordinary people doing ordinary sorts of things . and it's a morality play--where the hero has to face himself and his own actions . but if you can't park the expectations , you may very well hit a wall with this film . others have .
